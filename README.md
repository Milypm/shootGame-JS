> I created this web video-game which recreates some aspects of classic space-shooting games. I used the Phaser3 library for building the whole game environment and the different scenes, such as Boot, Preloader, Menu, Commands, Scores, Game and GameOver. I also used Webpack for bundling modules, classes and assets.
A provided API was used to store/retrieve the players/scores.

## Built With
- Phaser3
- JavaScript
- Webpack
- Git
- Jest
- Netlify (deployment)

## Game Context
Your spaceship is on a mission for collecting as many space diamonds (blue and white) as possible, while avoiding collisions with enemies and their lasers.

## How To Play (Browser)
- On the Menu scene, enter your name so we can save your name and score to our database (API)
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) for moving, avoid enemies/lasers, and to collect blue and white gems
- Use the spacebar to shoot lasers to the enemies

## How To Run It (On Local System)
- It's recommended to use Git's latest version.
- Clone or download the repo: [shootGame-JS](https://github.com/Milypm/shootGame-JS) to your local system
    - Click on the "Code" green button and copy 'HTTPS URL'
    - **On an empty folder** on your local system, open the command-line: `git clone 'HTTPS URL'`
- Go to the repo root directory
- Install webpack-dev-server: 'npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev'
- Run 'npm run serve'
- When the browser opens, click on 'dist' directory

## Tests (Code Editor Or Terminal/Command Line)
- Install Jest: 'npm install --save-dev jest'
- Run 'npm run test' or 'npm run watch' (for automatic Jest execution after updating the code)
